## How to use this project

App installation on Saleor is described here:

- from the command line: https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/installing-apps#installing-third-party-apps
- from graphQL API: https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/installing-apps#installation-using-graphql-api
- from dashboard: `https://<saleor-domain>/apps/install?manifestUrl=https://<app-domain>/api/manifest`

where `manifest` path is `https://<app-domain>/api/manifest`.

### Configuration

The App configuration can be done from the Saleor dashboard. After sucesfull app installation, go to `saleor-dashboard -> apps -> Saleor Avatax`:

- `API Key` is mandatory to activate the app. To generate API key, go to Avatax admin pannel -> Settings -> License and API keys -> Generate API key.
- `Ship from` details are mandatory for correct tax calculation.
- Enable `Active` when you are ready to use Avatax App.

> **Note**
> Checkouts and orders that are related to not configured channels will be skipped by App. Taxes will not be calculated for them. Make sure that you activate Avatax App for all required channels.

The Avatax tax group can be set in `Product` metadata or `ProductType` metadata. The expected metadata field name is `avatax_tax_code`. The Avatax tax groups can be found [here](https://taxcode.avatax.avalara.com).

```

Install dependencies `pnpm install`

Start local server `pnpm run dev`

Follow the guide [how install your app](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/installing-apps#installation-using-graphql-api) and use tunneling tools like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) in order to expose your local server.
